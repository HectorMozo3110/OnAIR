class Singleton:
    """
    A class for implementing singleton design pattern.

    This class ensures that only one instance of the class is created.

    Attributes
    ----------
    instance : cls
        The single instance of the Singleton subclass.
    """

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Ensures only one instance of the cls is created.

        This method overrides the default __new__ to implement the Singleton pattern.
        It creates a new instance only if one doesn't already exist, otherwise
        it returns the existing instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls : type
            The class that is instantiated, it must be a subclass of Singleton.
        *args : tuple
            Variable length argument list. Not used by Singleton, but may
            be used by the cls.
        **kwargs : dict
            Arbitrary keyword arguments. Not used by Singleton, but may
            be used by the cls.

        Returns
        -------
        instance : cls
            The single instance of the Singleton subclass.

        Note
        ----
        The __init__ method of the subclass will be called on every instantiation,
        therefore the subclass __init__ still needs to ensure proper singleton behavior.
