# NOTE: For testing singleton-like classes, a teardown procedure must be implemented
# to delete the instance after every test. Otherwise, proceeding tests will have
# access to the last test's instance. This happens due to the nature of singletons,
# which have a single instance per global scope (which the tests are running in).
